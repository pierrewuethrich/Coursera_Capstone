    "Let's assume that we got contacted by a client that wants to open a new coffee shop in the city of Tokyo. For that purpose, the client has asked us to explore the coffe-shop market in the area of Tokyo, hoping to better understand the current situation of coffee shops in this metropole. Knowing where coffee shops are located (and clustered) and what people liked most about them will give our client a valuable insights which will help them guide their decision making process (e.g. whether they have the ability to open a cafe and if so where).
